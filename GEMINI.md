# localbrain Project Implementation Plan

This document provides a detailed, implementation-ready plan for the GEMINI local-first context management system, designed for the Gemini CLI to implement using Python and Electron. The plan covers all major subsystems, package choices, module structure, and integration notes for challenge tracks.

---

## Overview

localbrain is a local-first model context management system that empowers AI applications with relevant context from files, exports, and live connectors. It stores ingested information semantically using embeddings and exposes a secure local API for LLM queries. The system is designed for modularity, extensibility, and high performance with a focus on Python backend and an Electron desktop frontend.

## Subsystems and Implementation Details

### 1. Electron Desktop Application (Frontend)

**Purpose:**  
User interface for interacting with GEMINI, including note-taking, search, settings, and ingestion management.

**Technology:**  
- Electron (Node.js + Chromium)  
- React + TypeScript for UI components  
- IPC (Inter-Process Communication) to communicate with MCP daemon

**Implementation Instructions:**  
- Scaffold Electron app with React and TypeScript  
- Implement UI modules:  
  - Notes and quick search interface  
  - Ingestion pipeline control panel (e.g., enable/disable connectors)  
  - Settings and user preferences  
- Use Electron IPC to call MCP daemon endpoints over local HTTP or direct IPC bridge  
- Package the Electron app with `electron-builder` for cross-platform distribution

**Module Structure:**  
- `/src/electron/` — Electron main process  
- `/src/ui/` — React components and pages  
- `/src/ipc/` — IPC handlers and client wrappers

### 2. MCP Daemon (Python Backend API Server)

**Purpose:**  
Core backend service exposing local API endpoints for LLM queries, ingestion control, ACL enforcement, and audit logging.

**Technology:**  
- FastAPI for high-performance async API  
- Uvicorn as ASGI server  
- Pydantic for data validation and ACL models  
- Loguru for structured logging

**Implementation Instructions:**  
- Create FastAPI app with routes for:  
  - Semantic search & retrieval  
  - Ingestion job management (start/stop connectors)  
  - LLM query proxying and orchestration  
  - Audit log retrieval and ACL enforcement  
- Implement ACL middleware using Pydantic models and dependency injection  
- Integrate logging with Loguru, capturing request and audit events  
- Package as a standalone Python service with dependency management (Poetry or pipenv)

**Module Structure:**  
- `/mcp/api.py` — FastAPI app and route definitions  
- `/mcp/auth.py` — ACL and authentication models  
- `/mcp/logging.py` — Audit and structured logging setup  
- `/mcp/llm_client.py` — Wrappers for GPT, Claude, local LLMs  
- `/mcp/config.py` — Configuration and environment management

### 3. Ingestion Layer

**Purpose:**  
Connectors and pipelines to ingest data from multiple sources, generate embeddings, and store data in vector DB.

**Technology:**  
- Python connectors for Gmail, Google Drive, Slack, iMessage, Notion, etc.  
- Sentence-Transformers for embedding generation  
- Chroma as the primary vector database (Python SDK)  
- Asyncio for concurrent ingestion tasks

**Implementation Instructions:**  
- Build modular connector classes for each data source with unified ingestion interface  
- Implement embedding generation pipeline using sentence-transformers  
- Store embeddings and metadata in Chroma vector DB  
- Design ingestion scheduler and job manager to run ingestion tasks periodically or on-demand  
- Provide error handling, retry logic, and ingestion status reporting

**Module Structure:**  
- `/ingestion/connectors/` — Source-specific connector modules  
- `/ingestion/embedding.py` — Embedding generation utilities  
- `/ingestion/storage.py` — Chroma vector DB interface  
- `/ingestion/scheduler.py` — Task scheduling and job management

---

### 4. Retrieval Layer

**Purpose:**  
Query vector DB and optionally graph DB to retrieve relevant context for LLM queries.

**Technology:**  
- Chroma for vector search  
- Optional lightweight graph storage with networkx (in-memory prototype)  
- Python wrappers to integrate retrieval results with LLM clients

**Implementation Instructions:**  
- Implement retrieval API to query Chroma with semantic similarity search  
- Aggregate results with metadata for context construction  
- If graph DB is enabled, augment retrieval with graph traversal results  
- Integrate retrieval layer with MCP daemon query endpoints  
- Optimize retrieval latency and caching for common queries

**Module Structure:**  
- `/retrieval/vector_search.py` — Chroma query interface  
- `/retrieval/graph_search.py` — Networkx graph utilities (optional)  
- `/retrieval/context_builder.py` — Context aggregation and formatting

## Integration Notes for Challenge Tracks

### 1. Interaction Company: Best MCP Automation

- Register MCP daemon endpoints (ingestion, semantic search, LLM queries) as "tools" or "tasks" in their automation platform.  
- Expose REST API endpoints with clear schemas for task registration.  
- Optionally implement webhook or scheduler hooks to trigger ingestion or summarization jobs automatically.

### 2. Elastic: Best use of the Elastic Agent Builder (Serverless)

- Map ingestion pipeline steps to Elastic Agent tool definitions.  
- Replace ElasticSearch with Chroma vector DB and networkx graph DB locally.  
- Expose MCP endpoints as Elastic Agent tools for ingestion, search, and LLM query.  
- Optionally ingest demo data into Elastic if required for challenge compliance.

### 3. Claude: Best Use of Claude

- Implement a Claude API client in `/mcp/llm_client.py` to call Anthropic’s Claude LLM.  
- After retrieval, forward context to Claude for summarization, question answering, or action generation.  
- Integrate Claude calls into MCP query pipeline with minimal latency.  
- Provide configuration for selecting Claude as the active LLM backend.

### 4. Chroma: Best AI application using Chroma

- Use Chroma as the primary vector DB for all embedding storage and retrieval.  
- Replace any existing FAISS or Annoy indexes with Chroma to leverage its Python SDK.  
- Optimize ingestion pipeline to batch insert embeddings into Chroma.  
- Use Chroma similarity search results as input context for LLM queries.  
- Provide metrics and monitoring for Chroma query performance.

---

## Development and Deployment

- Use Conda for Python dependency and environment management.  
- Use Docker Compose to orchestrate MCP daemon and Electron app for development.  
- Provide CLI commands for starting ingestion, running the MCP server, and packaging Electron app.  
- Include automated tests for connectors, API endpoints, and retrieval logic.
