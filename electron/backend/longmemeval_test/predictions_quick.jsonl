The stand mixer was repaired at a shop during May 2023, taking 2 weeks for the repair, which indicates the malfunction occurred during or shortly before that repair period in May 2023. Since the coffee maker purchase is dated to early May and the stand mixer malfunction/repair is referenced as occurring during May 2023 without a specific early date, the coffee maker purchase came first."}
