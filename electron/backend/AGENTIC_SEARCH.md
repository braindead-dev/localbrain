# Agentic Search - OpenCode-Inspired Retrieval

**NO embeddings. NO vector search. NO semantic retrieval.**

Just ripgrep + LLM with tools. Fast, simple, accurate.

---

## Philosophy

Inspired by OpenCode's retrieval system:

1. **LLM decides what to search** - Not a separate retrieval system
2. **Tool-based architecture** - LLM calls grep and read as needed
3. **Ripgrep for speed** - 10-100x faster than traditional grep
4. **Recent = Relevant** - Sort by modification time
5. **No indexing** - No upfront cost, no stale indexes

---

## How It Works

```
User: "What was my Meta offer?"
  ↓
LLM gets tools: grep_vault, read_file
  ↓
LLM calls: grep_vault(pattern="Meta.*offer")
  ↓
Ripgrep returns: ["career/Job Search.md", "offers/meta.md"]
  ↓
LLM calls: read_file("offers/meta.md")
  ↓
LLM synthesizes answer from file content
  ↓
Answer: "Meta offered $160k base, $40k sign-on, joining June 1st [offers/meta.md]"
```

**The LLM orchestrates everything. No separate retrieval pipeline.**

---

## Architecture

### Tools Available to LLM

**1. `grep_vault(pattern, limit=20)`**
- Uses ripgrep (rg) under the hood
- Searches all markdown files
- Returns files sorted by modification time (recent first)
- Includes preview snippet from each match
- Fallback to Python search if ripgrep not installed

**2. `read_file(filepath)`**
- Reads full markdown file
- Includes citations from .json file
- Returns content + metadata

### Agentic Loop

```python
while not done:
    # LLM decides what to do
    response = llm.call(messages, tools=[grep_vault, read_file])
    
    if response.wants_tools:
        # Execute tool calls
        results = execute_tools(response.tool_calls)
        messages.append(tool_results)
    else:
        # LLM has final answer
        return response.answer
```

---

## Usage

### Via Protocol URL

```bash
open "localbrain://agentic_search?query=What%20was%20my%20Meta%20offer?"
```

### Via API

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8765/protocol/agentic_search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "What was my Meta offer?"}'
```

### Via Python

```python
from agentic_search import AgenticSearch

searcher = AgenticSearch(vault_path)
result = searcher.search("What was my Meta offer?")

print(result['answer'])
# "Meta offered $160k base salary..."
```

### Test Script

```bash
python scripts/test_agentic_search.py "What was my Meta offer?"
```

---

## Speed

**Typical search (1000 markdown files):**

1. **Grep:** 50-100ms (ripgrep is blazingly fast)
2. **LLM decides what to read:** ~500-1000ms
3. **Read 3-5 files:** 10-20ms
4. **LLM synthesizes answer:** ~500-1000ms

**Total: ~1-2 seconds**

Compare to embeddings:
- Initial indexing: minutes to hours
- Query time: ~600ms (embedding + search + LLM)
- Reindexing on changes: seconds to minutes
- Storage: GB of vector data

**Agentic search is simpler, faster, and no upfront cost.**

## Why This Works

### 1. Modification Time = Relevance

When you're job searching, you edit job-related files. When planning trips, you edit travel files. Recent modifications = what you're thinking about = relevant.

OpenCode proved this works for codebases. It works even better for personal knowledge.

### 2. LLM is Smart About Context

The LLM can:
- Make multiple search attempts with different patterns
- Read files selectively (not everything that matches)
- Understand synonyms ("offer" vs "compensation" vs "salary")
- Synthesize from multiple files

You don't need semantic embeddings when you have a smart LLM.

### 3. Ripgrep is Fast Enough

Searching 10,000 markdown files with ripgrep: **~100ms**

That's faster than:
- Loading embeddings from disk: ~200ms
- Vector similarity search: ~50-100ms
- Total with embeddings: ~300-400ms

And ripgrep has no upfront cost.

## Example Queries

### Simple Search
```
Query: "What was my Meta offer?"

Tools used:
1. grep_vault("Meta.*offer")
2. read_file("offers/meta.md")

Answer: "Meta offered $160k base, $40k sign-on bonus..."
```

### Multi-File Synthesis
```
Query: "Compare all my job offers"

Tools used:
1. grep_vault("offer")
2. read_file("offers/meta.md")
3. read_file("offers/netflix.md")
4. read_file("offers/nvidia.md")

Answer: "You received 3 offers:
- Meta: $160k base, $40k sign-on
- Netflix: $180k base, $60k RSUs
- NVIDIA: $170k base, $50k sign-on
Highest total comp: Netflix"
```

### Exploration
```
Query: "What did I work on in college?"

Tools used:
1. grep_vault("college")
2. read_file("education/Stanford.md")
3. grep_vault("project")
4. read_file("projects/senior-thesis.md")

Answer: "At Stanford, you worked on..."
```

## Comparison: Embeddings vs Agentic Search

| Feature | Embeddings | Agentic Search |
|---------|-----------|----------------|
| **Setup time** | Minutes-hours (indexing) | 0 (no setup) |
| **Query time** | ~600ms | ~1-2s (includes LLM) |
| **Storage** | GBs (vector DB) | 0 extra |
| **Freshness** | Stale (reindex needed) | Always fresh |
| **Semantic** | Yes | LLM provides semantic understanding |
| **Explainability** | Poor (black box) | Great (see tool calls) |
| **Complexity** | High (embeddings + vector DB) | Low (grep + read) |
| **Cost** | Embedding model + storage | Just LLM calls |

---

## When Embeddings ARE Better

- **Huge scale:** 100k+ documents, need sub-100ms latency
- **Exact semantic matching:** Finding paraphrased content
- **Fuzzy similarity:** "Find similar documents"

But for personal knowledge vaults (100-10k documents), agentic search is simpler and faster.

---

## System Requirements

### Required
- Python 3.10+
- Anthropic API key (for Claude)
- FastAPI, uvicorn

### Optional but Recommended
- `ripgrep` (rg) - 10-100x faster than grep
  ```bash
  brew install ripgrep  # macOS
  ```
  Falls back to Python search if not available

---

## Configuration

### Vault Path

Set in `daemon.py`:
```python
VAULT_PATH = Path.home() / "Documents" / "GitHub" / "localbrain" / "my-vault"
```

### Max Iterations

Prevent infinite loops:
```python
max_iterations = 10  # in agentic_search.py
```

### Result Limit

Limit grep results:
```python
limit = 20  # Default in grep_vault tool
```

---

## Error Handling

### No Results
If grep finds nothing, LLM can try different patterns:
```python
# First attempt
grep_vault("Meta offer")  # No results

# LLM tries again
grep_vault("Meta")  # Finds files
```

### File Not Found
If file is deleted/moved between grep and read:
```python
read_file("offers/meta.md")  # Returns error
# LLM handles gracefully
```

### Max Iterations
Stops after 10 iterations to prevent runaway loops.

---
