# Pipeline V2 Redesign - Fixing Fundamental Issues

**Date:** October 25, 2025  
**Status:** Complete rewrite based on OpenCode architecture analysis

---

## Problems with V1

### 1. Citation Explosion 💥

**Issue:**
```json
{
  "6": {"quote": "Subject: Your Offer from Netflix"},
  "7": {"quote": "position of Software Engineer"},
  "8": {"quote": "full-time, exempt position"},
  "9": {"quote": "start date Monday, July 14"},
  "10": {"quote": "base salary $155,000"},
  "11": {"quote": "sign-on bonus $25,000"},
  "12": {"quote": "RSUs valued at $180,000"}
}
```

**Problem:** 
- Creating 10+ citations for ONE email source
- Each fact gets its own citation
- JSON files bloated with redundant metadata
- Citations not being used (just created wastefully)

**Root Cause:**
The formatter was told to "cite each factual claim separately" which created citation spam.

---

### 2. Premature File Selection 🎯❌

**V1 Flow:**
```
Input → [1] File Selection → [2] Format Content → [3] Determine Edits → Apply
         ↓
    WHERE before WHAT
```

**Problem:**
- Decides WHERE to edit before knowing WHAT to say
- Selects files speculatively ("might be relevant")
- Over-selection: 3 files when only 1 needed
- Then tries to justify selections with forced content

**Example:**
```
Agent: "I'll update Job Search, About Me, AND Resume"
(Without knowing what specifically to add)
Agent: "Now I need to write something for Resume..."
(Forced to create content to justify selection)
```

**Root Cause:**
Two-step process: routing → content creation. Should be ONE step.

---

### 3. Missing Validation ✓❌

**V1 Had No Checks For:**
- Are citations actually used in markdown?
- Do markdown [1], [2], [3] match JSON entries?
- Are we creating citations that never get referenced?

**Result:**
JSON files fill up with unused citations.

---

### 4. Sub-Optimal LLM Call Pattern

**V1: 7+ LLM Calls Per Ingestion**
```
1. File Selection (analyze context)
2. Format for File 1 (write markdown)
3. Edit Strategy for File 1 (determine placement)
4. Format for File 2
5. Edit Strategy for File 2
6. Format for File 3
7. Edit Strategy for File 3
```

**Problems:**
- Repeated context about same source content
- Each call doesn't know what other calls decided
- File 3's content doesn't know File 1's content
- Can lead to duplication

---

## V2 Solution: Single-Pass Analysis

### New Flow

```
Input
  ↓
[1 LLM CALL] Analyze & Route
  │ → Decides WHAT to say for each file
  │ → Decides WHERE to put it
  │ → Creates ONE citation for source
  │ → Pre-writes all content
  ↓
Apply Edits (deterministic, no LLM)
  ↓
Add Citation (same citation to all files)
  ↓
Validate (citations are used)
  ↓
Done
```

### Key Changes

**1. ContentAnalyzer replaces FileSelector + ContentFormatter**

```python
class ContentAnalyzer:
    """ONE call that does everything."""
    
    def analyze_and_route(self, context, source_metadata):
        """
        Returns:
        {
          "source_citation": {
            "quote": "Full excerpt from email (100-200 chars)",
            "note": "Job offer from Netflix"
          },
          "edits": [
            {
              "file": "career/Job Search.md",
              "priority": "primary",
              "content": "Received offer from Netflix for SWE - Content Streaming [1]. Salary $155k, bonus $25k, RSUs $180k [1]. Start July 14, 2025 [1].",
              "action": "append"
            },
            {
              "file": "personal/About Me.md", 
              "priority": "secondary",
              "content": "Accepted position at Netflix [1].",
              "action": "append"
            }
          ]
        }
        """
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Agent sees ALL edits at once (can avoid duplication)
- ✅ Content pre-written (no separate formatting step)
- ✅ ONE citation for entire source
- ✅ Only selects files with specific edits planned

---

### 2. One Citation Per Source

**New Rule:**
- Entire source document = ONE citation entry
- All facts from that source reference same [1]
- Quote is representative excerpt, not individual fact

**Example:**

**Source:** Netflix job offer email

**Citation (ONE entry):**
```json
{
  "1": {
    "platform": "Gmail",
    "timestamp": "2024-10-25T10:00:00Z",
    "url": null,
    "quote": "I am thrilled to extend to you an offer of employment for the position of Software Engineer - Content Streaming. Your starting base salary will be $155,000 per year...",
    "note": "Job offer from Netflix for SWE position"
  }
}
```

**Markdown:**
```markdown
Received official offer from Netflix for Software Engineer - Content Streaming [1].
Base salary $155,000 [1], sign-on bonus $25,000 [1], and RSUs valued at $180,000 [1].
Position located in Los Gatos, California [1].
Start date July 14, 2025 [1].
```

**Key Points:**
- [1] referenced 5 times
- But only ONE citation entry in JSON
- All facts cite same source

---

### 3. Priority-Aware Content Generation

**Prompt includes:**
```
DETAIL LEVEL RULES:
- PRIMARY: Full details (salary $155k, bonus $25k, specific dates)
- SECONDARY: Key fact only ("Accepted position at Netflix")
```

**LLM writes DIFFERENT content for each priority:**

```json
{
  "edits": [
    {
      "file": "career/Job Search.md",
      "priority": "primary",
      "content": "Received offer from Netflix [1]. Salary $155k, bonus $25k, RSUs $180k [1]. Start July 14, 2025 [1]."
    },
    {
      "file": "personal/About Me.md",
      "priority": "secondary",
      "content": "Accepted Software Engineer position at Netflix [1]."
    }
  ]
}
```

**No duplication!** Same source, different detail levels.

---

### 4. Simple Edit Application

**V2 Edit Logic:**
```python
def _edit_file(self, file_path, content, plan):
    """Simple append - content already formatted."""
    
    existing = read_file(file_path)
    
    if '## Related' in existing:
        # Insert before Related section
        parts = existing.split('## Related')
        new_content = f"{parts[0]}\n{content}\n\n## Related{parts[1]}"
    else:
        # Append at end
        new_content = f"{existing}\n\n{content}\n"
    
    write_file(file_path, new_content)
```

**Why simpler?**
- Content is PRE-WRITTEN by analyzer
- No need for FileModifier to determine placement
- Just append before ## Related section
- Deterministic, no LLM call needed

---

### 5. Citation Validation

**New validation step:**
```python
def _validate_citations(self, edit_plans):
    """Check that citations are actually used."""
    
    errors = []
    for plan in edit_plans:
        # Does content reference [1]?
        if '[1]' not in plan['content']:
            continue  # OK for secondary files
        
        # Is [1] actually in the file?
        file_content = read_file(file_path)
        if '[1]' not in file_content:
            errors.append(f"{plan['file']}: Citation not found in file")
    
    return errors
```

**Catches:**
- Citations created but not used
- Markdown missing citation markers
- Mismatched citation numbers

## Comparison: V1 vs V2

### LLM Calls

| Step | V1 | V2 |
|------|----|----|
| **File Selection** | 1 call | — |
| **Content Formatting** | 1 per file (3 calls) | — |
| **Edit Strategy** | 1 per file (3 calls) | — |
| **Analysis & Routing** | — | **1 call** |
| **Edit Application** | No LLM | No LLM |
| **TOTAL** | **7 calls** | **1 call** |

**Result:** 7x fewer API calls, 7x faster, 7x cheaper

---

### Citation Management

| Aspect | V1 | V2 |
|--------|----|----|
| **Citations per source** | 10+ | 1 |
| **JSON bloat** | High | Minimal |
| **Unused citations** | Common | Prevented |
| **Validation** | None | Built-in |

---

### File Selection Accuracy

| Metric | V1 | V2 |
|--------|----|----|
| **Over-selection** | Common (3 files when 1 needed) | Rare |
| **Forced content** | Yes (justify selections) | No |
| **Duplication risk** | High | Low |
| **Edit quality** | Variable | Consistent |

---

## Inspired by OpenCode

### Key Lessons Applied

**1. Single-Pass Analysis**
> OpenCode: Edit tool gets context once, makes decision
> V2: Analyzer gets context once, plans all edits

**2. Pre-Written Content**
> OpenCode: LLM writes exact `oldString` and `newString`
> V2: LLM writes exact content to insert

**3. Deterministic Application**
> OpenCode: Fuzzy matching engine (no LLM)
> V2: Simple append logic (no LLM)

**4. Validation Feedback**
> OpenCode: LSP errors fed back to LLM
> V2: Citation validation catches mistakes

**5. Constraint-Based Prompts**
> OpenCode: "Must read before edit", "Unique match required"
> V2: "ONE citation per source", "Write specific content"

---

## Testing V2

### Example Input

**File:** `example_content.txt`
```
Subject: Your Offer from Netflix
...
Your starting base salary will be $155,000 per year. 
In addition, you will be eligible for a sign-on bonus of $25,000 
and an initial grant of RSUs valued at $180,000, which will vest over four years.
...
```

### Expected V2 Output

**ONE LLM Call Returns:**
```json
{
  "source_citation": {
    "platform": "Gmail",
    "timestamp": "2024-10-25T10:00:00Z",
    "quote": "Your starting base salary will be $155,000 per year. In addition, you will be eligible for a sign-on bonus of $25,000 and an initial grant of RSUs valued at $180,000...",
    "note": "Netflix job offer for Software Engineer - Content Streaming"
  },
  "edits": [
    {
      "file": "career/Job Search.md",
      "priority": "primary",
      "content": "Received official offer from Netflix for Software Engineer - Content Streaming position [1]. Base salary $155,000 per year [1], sign-on bonus $25,000 [1], and RSUs valued at $180,000 vesting over 4 years [1]. Position located in Los Gatos, California with start date of July 14, 2025 [1].",
      "action": "append"
    },
    {
      "file": "personal/About Me.md",
      "priority": "secondary",
      "content": "Accepted Software Engineer position at Netflix [1].",
      "action": "append"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Files Modified:**
- `career/Job Search.md` - Full details appended
- `personal/About Me.md` - Brief mention appended

**Citations Added:**
```json
// career/Job Search.json
{
  ...,
  "6": {
    "platform": "Gmail",
    "timestamp": "2024-10-25T10:00:00Z",
    "url": null,
    "quote": "Your starting base salary will be $155,000 per year...",
    "note": "Netflix job offer for SWE - Content Streaming"
  }
}

// personal/About Me.json
{
  ...,
  "4": {
    "platform": "Gmail",
    "timestamp": "2024-10-25T10:00:00Z", 
    "url": null,
    "quote": "Your starting base salary will be $155,000 per year...",
    "note": "Netflix job offer for SWE - Content Streaming"
  }
}
```

**Note:** Same citation content in both files (ONE source)

---

## Testing Commands

### Using the script:

```bash
# Activate environment
conda activate localbrain

# Test V2 pipeline
python scripts/ingest_from_file.py scripts/example_content.txt

# With metadata
python scripts/ingest_from_file.py content.txt metadata.json
```

### Direct CLI:

```bash
python src/agentic_ingest_v2.py ~/my-vault "Your content here"
```

---

## Migration Path

### For now:
- V1 remains at `src/agentic_ingest.py` (old pipeline)
- V2 is at `src/agentic_ingest_v2.py` (new pipeline)
- Scripts use V2 by default

### After testing:
1. Verify V2 fixes all issues
2. Run extensive tests
3. Replace V1 with V2
4. Delete old pipeline code

---

## Summary

### V2 Fixes:

✅ **One citation per source** (not 10+)  
✅ **Single-pass analysis** (WHAT + WHERE together)  
✅ **Pre-written content** (no separate formatting)  
✅ **Citation validation** (ensures they're used)  
✅ **7x fewer LLM calls** (1 vs 7)  
✅ **No over-selection** (only files with specific edits)  
✅ **No duplication** (sees all edits at once)  

### Core Insight:

**V1 Problem:** Decided WHERE before WHAT → forced content creation  
**V2 Solution:** Decide WHAT first, then WHERE naturally follows → organic content

This matches OpenCode's approach: LLM writes the exact text to insert, then deterministic engine applies it.

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Test V2 with Netflix offer example
2. ⬜ Test multi-topic content
3. ⬜ Test edge cases (empty vault, long content, etc.)
4. ⬜ Compare V1 vs V2 results side-by-side
5. ⬜ If V2 superior, deprecate V1
