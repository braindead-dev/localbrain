# Ingestion Engine

Processes and stores new documents and data into the LocalBrain system. Responsible for intelligent extraction of insights, observations, and maintaining the structured filesystem.

## Core Responsibilities

- **Document Processing**: Ingest and parse various file formats
- **Content Chunking**: Split documents into searchable segments
- **Embedding Generation**: Create vector representations for semantic search
- **Insight Extraction**: Identify key observations and patterns
- **Source Citation Management**: Track and link supporting evidence
- **File Structure Management**: Maintain standardized markdown format

## Guardrails & Security

**Sensitive Data Protection:**
- Automatic detection and filtering of passwords, SSNs, credit cards
- Pattern-based recognition of sensitive information
- Sanitization before storage and processing
- Configurable filtering rules

**Data Quality:**
- Content validation and cleaning
- Duplicate detection and merging
- Metadata extraction and validation
- Error handling and recovery

## Document Processing Pipeline

1. **Input Reception**: Accept data from connectors or direct upload
2. **Format Detection**: Identify file type and structure
3. **Content Extraction**: Parse and clean document content
4. **Security Filtering**: Remove sensitive information
5. **Chunking Strategy**: Split into optimal search segments
6. **Embedding Generation**: Create vector representations
7. **Metadata Creation**: Extract and store file/source metadata
8. **Storage**: Save chunks, embeddings, and metadata to database

## Markdown File Structure

**Standardized Format:**
- **Purpose Summary**: Auto-generated intro paragraph explaining file content
- **Observations Section**: Key insights and findings
- **Sources Section**: Supporting evidence with metadata

**Source Citation Format:**
```
**Claim:** [Specific statement requiring evidence]

**Source:** [Platform] - [Timestamp]
[Direct quotation from source]
[URL if applicable]
```

**Auto-Initialization:**
- Files created with template structure
- Purpose summary generated by system prompt
- Manual editing allowed and preserved

## Integration Points

- **Connectors**: Receive data from external sources
- **Frontend**: Accept direct file uploads and quick notes
- **Retrieval**: Provide processed content for search indexing
- **Filesystem**: Create and manage `.localbrain/` directory structure

## Configuration

- **Chunking Parameters**: Configurable segment sizes and overlap
- **Embedding Models**: Selectable vectorization strategies
- **Processing Rules**: Customizable content filtering and extraction
- **Storage Options**: Database selection and configuration
