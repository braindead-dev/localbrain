## Doc Philosophy

**Keep it simple:**
- Each doc has one clear purpose
- No duplication between docs
- Short and actionable
- Examples over theory

**Main README** = Getting started + usage  
**SEARCH.md** = How search works  
**INGESTION.md** = How ingestion works  
**Everything else** = Supporting details

That's it! ðŸš€
