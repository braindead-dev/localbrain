# LocalBrain

Personal AI context management system - local-first architecture for managing life context.

## Overview

Building a desktop application that ingests data from various sources (emails, messages, documents) and makes it searchable using embeddings and semantic search.

## Goals

- Create a truly local-first knowledge management system
- Support multiple data connectors (Gmail, Discord, Slack, etc.)
- Implement semantic search using sentence transformers
- Build MCP server for AI tool integration
- Maintain complete user privacy - all data stays local

## Stack

**Frontend:**
- Electron + Next.js
- React for UI components
- TailwindCSS for styling

**Backend:**
- Python 3.10 with FastAPI
- ChromaDB for vector storage
- SQLAlchemy for metadata
- Sentence Transformers for embeddings

Started development on October 1, 2024 [1]. Currently in Phase 1 - building core ingestion and vault management system.
